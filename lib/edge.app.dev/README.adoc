// tag::content[]
Provides application dev files for use in applications.

== deps.edn

`juxt.edge/lib.app.dev {:local/root "../lib/edge.app.dev"}`

== Usage

Put the coordinate in your deps.edn, usually in an alias named `:dev`. 
In your `dev/dev.clj` set up your namespace like so:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns dev
  (:require
    [dev-extras :refer :all]))
----

The vars that this brings in are development-related utilities.
Also provides a development-oriented logging setup with filtering and file rotation.
